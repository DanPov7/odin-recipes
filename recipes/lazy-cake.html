    <p>Lazy cake is one of my favourite recipes. It is delicious, doesn't require a lot of time or
        culinary skills. On top of that it only requires four simple ingredients! 
    </p>

    <p><strong>Here they are:</strong></p>

    <ul>

        <li><strong>Cocoa powder</strong></li>

        <li><strong>Melted unsalted butter </strong></li>  

        <li><strong>Sweetened condensed milk </strong></li>

        <li><strong>Biscuits </strong></li>

    </ul>

    <p><strong>The steps:</strong></p>

    <ol>
        <li>Stir together <em>melted butter</em>, <em>cocoa powder</em> and <em>condensed milk</em>
        until a smooth chocolate sauce forms.</li>

        <li>Crush your biscuits. Be careful not to crush them too finely, you want to keep the chunks
            large. Afterwards fold them with the chocolate sauceto combine.
        </li>
        
        <li>Freeze the mixture for two to three hours.</li>

    </ol>

        <p>And thats it, the dish is done!</p>
