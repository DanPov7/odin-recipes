    <ol>
        <li>Add the heavy cream, sweetened condensed milk, vanilla and creme caramel powder to 
            a bowl and beat until soft peaks form. Set this cream mixture aside.</li>

        <li>Dip the tea biscuits into the coffee briefly until they soak up the coffee but 
        before they start to break apart. Layer in 7 x 11 or 9 x 9 inch clear pyrex dish, then top
    with half the crean mixture.</li>
    
        <li>Repear another layer of coffee soaked biscuits on top of the heavy cream, followed by
            the remaining half of the cream. Sift the cocoa powder on to the top, then refrigerate
            for several hours until set. This is even better the next day.</li>
