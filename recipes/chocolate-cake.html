    <p>Easiest recipe here, since it's made with cake mix. It barely takes any time to make and it 
       tastes amazing!
    </p>
       
    

    <p><strong>The ingredients:</strong></p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Chocolate cake mix (requires eggs, boiled water, oil and eggs)</strong></li>

        <li><strong>Caramel sauce</strong></li>

        <li><strong>Sweetened condensed milk</strong></li>

        <li><strong>Chocolate covered toffee bars</strong></li>

        <li><strong>A whipped cream topping</strong></li>

    </ul>

    <p><strong>The recipe:</strong></p>

    <ol>
        <li>Make the cake according to package directions. Bake until toothpick inserted into the
            center comes out clean, also according to package directions.</li>

        <li>Right before the cake is done, prepare the caramel topping so itâ€™s ready to pour on the cake 
            when it comes out of the oven. Simply melt together the caramel sauce and condensed milk, over 
            low heat and set aside.</li>
    
        <li>When the warm cake comes out of the oven, poke it all over to make holes. I find this 
            easiest to do with the bottom of a wooden spoon or a butter knife but you can use a fork. 
            Pour the condensed milk topping all over the cake, and allow it to sink in and cool slightly.</li>

        <li>Sprinkle cake all over with chocolate toffee bits</li> 
        
        <li>Make the whipped cream by whipping together the heavy cream, icing sugar and vanilla 
            until soft peaks form. Spread this all over the cooled cake.</li>

        <li>Refrigerate until ready to serve.You can garnish with extra toffee bits and some 
            caramel sauce if you like. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>

    <p>And thats it, the dish is done!</p>
